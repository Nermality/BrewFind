So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today. We still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Brian and Jenn Cook created Kingdom Brewing with the intent to brew terrific craft beers from a wide variety of locally produced ingredients. Starting with American grown grains, they add locally produced ingredients such as maple sap, spruce tips or apples to create a variety of light to robust seasonal beers.  In addition to their homegrown philosophy, the Cooks run Kingdom Brewing in the most environmentally friendly way possible. One common problem for many brewers is finding a way to dispose of the mash left over from the brewing process. The Black Angus beef herd on the Cook’s farm happily dispose of the spent grains for them.
