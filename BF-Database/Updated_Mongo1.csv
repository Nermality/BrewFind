At Otter Creek we've been creating exciting, award-winning craft brews for more than 20 years. The beers we brew and the menu offerings from our pub are handcrafted with fresh and local ingredients.   With a focus on sustainability, we have managed to dramatically reduce our contribution to the waste stream and are always looking for new ways to improve on this front. Our spent hops and yeast are donated to local farmers for use as an alternative fertilizer, while our spent grain feeds local dairy cows.   Our 2010 brewery expansion was done with an attention to energy efficiency. Major investment and expansion continues into 2014. The addition of six new fermenting tanks has added 30,000 barrels to our annual capacity, while a new, state-of-the-art filling machine allows us to efficiently meet the demands of our growing operation.
