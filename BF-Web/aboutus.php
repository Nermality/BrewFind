                   <h2>BrewFind</h2>
                    <p>BrewFind started as a project for a Software Engineering assignment and developed a year later into our Senior Project. The idea behind the project came from one of our developers, Ted Moore, who was trying to plan for a visit from his sister who lives in Oregon. He knew she was a beer geek like him, and he wanted to plan a trip to some of Vermont’s amazing breweries. The trouble Ted ran into while doing this, was having to jump from site - to - site trying to get brewery hours, brewery taps and locations to lay out a good trip for himself and his sister. This gave him the idea of BrewFind - a mobile application and conjoined website where he, and other people, would be able to view breweries, their locations, and what they have on tap.
Ted proposed the idea as a senior project and we were all on board immediately. All five members of our team are long time Vermonters who have spent most, or all, of our lives in this great state and as such all developed a taste for great beer.

                    <p>BrewFind is a mobile application and website designed to help users better find local breweries, what they have on tap, and what events breweries are attending or hosting. Currently, BrewFind is in development for Android and will later be available for iOS. BrewFind will work in conjunction with Untappd to gather drink data, and the Vermont Brewer’s Association to digitalize their passport program. In addition, a big part of BrewFind will be working with Vermont’s Breweries to get accurate, up-to-date information for users to view current taps, upcoming events, and general brewery information.</p>
